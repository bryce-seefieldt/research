## 3.1 Analysis 

### The Rise of AI-Generated Content in Visual Arts

Key Findings:

#### NTIRE 2024 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge :

This paper provides an overview of recent advancements in AI-generated images and videos through challenges assessing quality. Key developments include text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. These models create high-quality visual content by understanding prompts provided by users, using advanced neural networks such as diffusion models.

The challenge focused on developing and evaluating methods for image quality assessment (IQA) and video quality assessment (VQA) to standardize how AI-generated visual content is evaluated. Datasets with AI-generated images and videos (AIGIs and AIGVs) were created to benchmark the models.

#### Techne as Technology and Techne as Art​:

This study explores the philosophical foundation of the relationship between art and technology, suggesting that AI-generated art is redefining traditional notions of art. It traces the history of techne (a concept denoting both art and technology in ancient Greece) and how modern AI tools have transformed visual arts.

The emergence of AI has led to a new approach to art, one that focuses less on the creation process and more on conceptualization. This shift resembles the impact of conceptual art in the 20th century and challenges traditional views of artistic authorship and authenticity.

### Legal Definitions and Debates Around Copyright Infringement Related to AI
Key Findings from the Papers:
#### The Influence of Artificial Intelligence on Copyright Law​:

This paper examines the legal ambiguities related to copyright protection for AI-generated works, specifically focusing on issues of authorship and originality. The concept of originality has been foundational to copyright law, but the rise of AI-generated content blurs the lines between human and non-human creativity.

It highlights legal challenges in defining whether the human creator of the AI, the user of the AI, or the AI itself holds copyright ownership. Notably, the paper explores policy proposals and legal cases in the European Union (EU) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), emphasizing the importance of international collaboration to develop cohesive copyright guidelines for AI-generated content.

#### The Economics of Copyright in the Digital Age​:

This paper explores the evolution of copyright laws in response to digital technologies, including AI. The authors review historical shifts in copyright law to accommodate new media and emerging technologies. They suggest that the current framework needs further adaptation to address issues like algorithmic licensing and copyright exceptions for training datasets.
The paper discusses copyright enforcement mechanisms such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the US and the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the EU, and how these regulations impact AI-generated content.
Moral and Economic Rights of Visual Artists
Key Findings from the Papers:

#### A Perspective on NFTs in the Arts and Music Industry​:

This paper investigates the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to transform ownership and revenue models for visual artists. It argues that blockchain-based technologies like NFTs can empower artists by offering verifiable ownership and royalty mechanisms, allowing artists to earn revenue from their works’ resale.
However, the paper also highlights challenges, such as the lack of standardized regulations and legal ambiguities regarding IP rights associated with digital assets like NFTs.

#### Techne as Technology and Techne as Art​:

This paper provides a philosophical critique of instrumentalism, where technology dominates and commodifies art, reducing the role of the artist to a means of production. It suggests that AI-generated art can challenge the moral rights of artists by appropriating their styles or creations, leading to concerns about authenticity and attribution.

## 3.2. Identify Patterns, Gaps, and Key Insights

### Common Themes and Patterns

#### Technological Innovation and Artistic Transformation:

AI-generated content is revolutionizing the creative process and challenging traditional notions of artistic authorship. Similar to the rise of conceptual art, AI shifts the focus from creation to conceptualization, changing how art is perceived.

#### Legal Ambiguities in Copyright Law: 
There is a clear challenge in defining the legal status of AI-generated content, particularly concerning issues like authorship, originality, and moral rights. Legal frameworks in the EU and US are beginning to address these issues, but inconsistencies across jurisdictions remain a major gap.
#### Economic Rights and Digital Ownership: 
Emerging technologies like NFTs and smart contracts are redefining ownership in the digital age, allowing artists to secure revenue streams through royalties and resale rights. However, the legal infrastructure to support these innovations is still evolving.

### Gaps Identified

#### Lack of Standardized Legal Definitions:
There are conflicting legal definitions of authorship and originality in different jurisdictions, which complicates international enforcement of copyright protections for AI-generated works.

#### Uncertainty Around Ownership Models: 
The rise of NFTs introduces new ownership models that have not yet been fully integrated into existing legal frameworks, raising concerns about IP rights and attribution.
