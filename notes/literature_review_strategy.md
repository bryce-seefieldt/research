# Literature Review Strategy

**_Strategies for executing systematic literature review for the "AI and the Arts" research project_**

## Themes
Summarize key literature on the following topics:

1. The rise of AI-generated content in visual arts.
2. Legal definitions and debates around copyright infringement related to AI.
3. Moral and economic rights of visual artists and how AI-generated content challenges them.

## Scope
Summarize relevant existing literature on the three key topics mentioned above.

## Purpose
Literature review should provide a foundation for understanding the current state of research, identify gaps in the existing literature, and justify research questions.

## Systematic Search for Literature
### Search Strings for Seneca Libraries Search Functionality

Search Criteria and Strategies to Consider:
- Use Boolean Operators: Combine AND, OR, NOT to refine search results.
- Use Quotation Marks: For exact phrases such as "AI-generated content".
- Use Truncation: Use the asterisk * to find multiple variations of a word (e.g., “artist*” to find artist, artists, artistry).
- Apply Filters: If the Seneca Libraries search engine allows, apply filters to limit results to peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, legal cases, journals, or books.

### Search Strings for Google Scholar and Google Scholar Case Law
When using Google Scholar, it’s helpful to start with broad searches and then narrow down by date, relevance, or citation count. You can use Google Scholar filters to refine results to peer-reviewed articles, legal reviews, and recent publications. Similarly, Google Scholar Case Law focuses specifically on legal case documents.

#### Search Strings for Google Scholar
```
"AI-generated content" AND "visual arts"
```
```
"generative art" OR "creative AI" AND "visual art"
```
```
"AI art" AND "art industry" AND "creative processes"
```
```
"artificial intelligence" AND "art creation" AND "digital media"
```
```
"copyright law" AND "intellectual property" AND "AI-generated"
```
```
"copyright infringement" AND "AI-generated art"
```
```
"moral rights" OR "economic rights" AND "visual artists" AND "AI-generated content"
```
```
"moral rights" AND "artificial intelligence art"
```
```
"legal ownership" OR "authorship AI art"
"case studies" OR "case law" AND "AI copyright infringement"
```

#### Search Strings for Google Scholar Case Law
```
"intellectual property" AND "AI-generated content" AND "copyright"
```
```
"copyright infringement" AND "AI-generated" AND "legal case"

### Additional Tips for Search Refinement
#### Use Google Scholar Filters:
After performing a search, filter by publication date to find the most recent or relevant research. You can limit your results to the last 5 years to match your research focus on the impact of AI in recent years.

#### Leverage Citation Networks:

In Google Scholar, look for highly cited articles and explore the papers that have cited these articles. This will help you find more relevant and authoritative sources.

#### Refine Searches by Discipline:

Use Seneca Libraries filters to search within specific academic fields like law, art, or technology to find more discipline-specific sources.

### Summary of Search Strategy
- Use the detailed search strings provided to systematically find relevant literature in Seneca Libraries, Google Scholar, and Google Scholar Case Law.
- Refine your searches using database filters for peer-reviewed articles, case studies, legal reviews, and books.
- Organize and tag your sources in Zotero by key topics to help you manage and cite your references in Overleaf.


## 2. Analyze and Synthesize the Literature
After gathering a sufficient number of sources, the next step is to analyze and synthesize the information collected.

### Step 2.1: Summarize Key Findings for Each Topic
#### The Rise of AI-Generated Content in Visual Arts:

- Look for papers and industry reports that discuss the growth of AI tools in the visual arts (e.g., GANs, style transfer models, generative algorithms like DALL-E, etc.).
- Summarize the advancements in AI-driven creativity and the proliferation of AI-generated art in the visual arts industry over the past 5-10 years.

#### Legal Definitions and Debates Around Copyright Infringement Related to AI:
- Find articles and legal case summaries that address how the law defines authorship for AI-generated content.
Summarize debates around the legal ownership of AI-generated works and how copyright law currently addresses (or fails to address) these issues.
- Identify gaps or challenges, such as whether AI-generated content can be considered an “original work” and who should own the rights (e.g., the creator of the AI, the user, or the AI itself).

#### Moral and Economic Rights of Visual Artists:

- Explore literature that examines artists’ moral rights (e.g., the right to attribution) and economic rights (e.g., royalties) in relation to AI-generated content.
Identify specific challenges posed by AI, such as cases where AI-generated art mimics or repurposes existing works without proper attribution.

### Step 2.2: Identify Patterns, Gaps, and Key Insights
- Look for common themes across the literature, such as emerging legal trends, artist perceptions of AI-generated content, or inconsistencies in how laws are applied to AI-generated works.
- Identify gaps in the current research. For example:
Are there conflicting legal definitions of authorship in different jurisdictions?
- Do visual artists feel adequately protected against AI-generated content that appropriates their style or work?
Highlight contradictions or ongoing debates. For example, there may be varying opinions on whether AI-generated works should have legal protections comparable to human-made works.
### Step 2.3: Create an Outline for Your Literature Review
Based on your analysis, create a rough outline for the literature review section. Here’s an example outline:
#### Introduction to the Literature Review: 
Briefly introduce the purpose and scope of the literature review.
#### The Rise of AI-Generated Content in Visual Arts:
Summarize key developments in generative AI and its applications in the visual arts.

#### Legal Definitions and Debates Around Copyright Infringement:
- Discuss the current legal definitions and ownership issues concerning AI-generated content.
- Highlight key court cases and rulings.

#### Moral and Economic Rights of Visual Artists:
- Explore the impact of AI-generated content on artists’ moral and economic rights.
- Discuss perspectives from visual artists and legal experts on the adequacy of current laws.
#### Gaps and Unresolved Issues:
Identify gaps in the literature and ongoing debates relevant to your research questions.
